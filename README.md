# demo_DRED-DIP
# Deep Image Prior (DIP) has emerged as a powerful image restoration technique, but it still faces limitations.
# Particularly, DIP struggles when handling complex degradation scenarios involving mixed image artifacts. 
# To address this limitation, we propose a novel technique to enhance Deep Image Prior's performance in handling mixed image degradation. 
# Our approach leverages additional priors and incorporates advanced regularization methods into the optimization process of DIP. 
# Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, showing significant improvements in restoring images corrupted by mixed degradation. 
# We compare our method against state-of-the-art approaches and highlight its superiority in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. 
# Our research provides a valuable enhancement to the Deep Image Prior framework, offering a more robust solution for image restoration in 
# challenging mixed degradation scenarios.
